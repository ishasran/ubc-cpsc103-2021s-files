Please see: *insert the URL (web address) to the data you plan to use for the information source*. As requested, I have also uploaded the file with this submission. My question is: How does team colour choice (which I know from playing this game is a sort of 'marker of tribe') impact performance? As a backup, I'll use the video game sales information source and try to do something similar to my plan below but for which company created a game and how much money it made.\""
