    "How should we design our functions? Follow the *recipe* or just design *randomly*?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, obviously, follow the recipe. For completely unrelated fun, however, let's see how often those words have appeared in books in English since 1850. We'll use data from [Google's ngram project](http://storage.googleapis.com/books/ngrams/books/datasetsv2.html). We'll get counts of the number of occurrences of each word in a given year (or None if the word is missing for that year).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Design a function that takes a list of word frequency data and graphs both the \"recipe\" and \"randomly\" frequencies (on the y axis) against the year.** Your function may assume that the data provided are in order by year. Be sure to give your graph a title, a legend, axes labels, and contrasting colours for the two plotted lines. Remember to follow the helper rules. Often you will find it *very* useful to design helper functions to extract the x values and y values for your graph. (In this case, there are two sets of y values and so perhaps two helper functions for those.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Where no data is available for a frequency in a year, just plot a 0.** (But you may also be curious to experiment with what it looks like to plot `None` instead.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember also that each function you design should be tested, and any function that produces a graph will need more than just an `expect`. It will also need either a very clear description of what we should see in the graph or (better yet) a sketch showing what we should see so that we can check that the function produces what was expected when run.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finish by calling your function on `FULL_LIST` (but note that `FULL_LIST` is too large to be a good test set for your function). "
